# Data Mining – Forest Fire Analysis in Portugal  

Project developed in the Master’s in Data Science at Polytechnic of Leiria (2024/2025), for the course *Data Mining*.  

## Objective  
Apply the **CRISP-DM methodology** to analyze forest fire data in Portugal (2001–2025), using ICNF’s official dataset.  

## Main Tasks  
- Business and data understanding (objectives, risks, data quality).  
- Data preparation: cleaning, feature engineering, dataset creation.  
- Modeling with different techniques:  
  - **Association Rules** – identify fire patterns.  
  - **Regression** – estimate first response times.  
  - **Classification** – predict reignition events.  
  - **Clustering** – create territorial risk profiles.  
- Evaluation and comparison of models (accuracy, F1-score, silhouette index).  
- Proposal of insights for fire prevention and resource optimization.  

## Results  
- **Association Rules:** confidence up to **78%** for frequent patterns.  
- **Regression:** R² of **65%** for response time prediction.  
- **Classification:** accuracy of **72%**, F1-score of **70%** in reignition prediction.  
- **Clustering:** silhouette score of **0.61**, producing meaningful territorial risk profiles.
